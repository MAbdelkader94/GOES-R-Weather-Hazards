## Project Description
The goal of our project is to effectively utilize the vast datasets from GEOS observations to create an actionable, real-time monitoring system that aids in identifying and responding to weather hazards in the continental U.S. Our approach emphasizes user-friendly visualizations, efficient data processing, and precise alert systems.

## Features
- **Real-time Data Monitoring:** Seamlessly integrates GEOS observational data to provide up-to-the-minute insights.
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Offers intuitive and interactive charts and maps to represent complex weather data.
- **Alert System:** Users can set custom thresholds for various weather parameters to receive timely alerts.
- **Cloud-based Data Retrieval:** Efficiently fetches and processes data from cloud services.
- **Open Source:** Encourages community contributions and improvements.
